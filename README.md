# Description

Project for the subject Advanced Programming. The project is about 'remaking' Pacman with C++ and SFML. I learn to apply
the principles of object-oriented programming and software design.
There is also usage of threads and mutexes.

# Known Issues

- There's no actual game yet, only the frontend is implemented
- Updating and handling input is too fast, you cannot pause and resume with the same key
